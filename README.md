# Distributed .NET training

This repository contains training support for C# and "distributed architectures" in .NET.

It was created for a course at IUT Lyon 1 (LP DASI). That's why it starts with a basic C# discovery.

Each numbered directory is a 4 hour session, with code to start with. It is TDD/TDL (Test Driven Development/Learning), quite a bit like Koans.

There is a Reaveal.js presentation for each session guiding people through each session. You can view presentations through this page : http://devcrafting.github.io/Distributed.NETTraining/.
For English people, presentation is in French, but exercices are in English.
You can follow the course checking out Git tags named TDx.y.z in ascending order, and uncommenting tests one by one until completion. 
It is recommended to checkout a first tag to start, create a working branch based on it, and then merging next tags one after the other.
